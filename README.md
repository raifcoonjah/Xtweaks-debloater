3. If you find or experienced any bugs or errors, please report them on issues tab.
4. If you're willing to help or have a test device, hit me up on IG <a href="https://instagram.com/mraif13">here</a>
5. If you get yourself in any problems which should not happen but if you do, a quick restart can easily fix the bug if not, back up your phone on Smart Switch then do a reset.
6. Removed youtube? Used vanced instead. It comes with build in adblocking, picture and picture and more, find more info: <a href="https://vanced.app/">Here</a> 
7. Please don't steal this and make it seems like it's yours. We put hours every week to improve and add new commands.

5. You will see that the system is starting the ADB daemon starting. If this is your first time running ADB, you should see a prompt on your phone asking you to authorize a connection with the computer. Grant it by clicking on OK and tick the "Always allow from this computer" for later use.
6. Afterwards retype in adb devices or ./adb devices in the terminal/command if you see  the serial number of your device then you're good if not try reconnecting your device and trying again.
